# Markovian-Queueing-System
Implement an event-driven simulation of Markovian queueing system to calculate performance measures of the system such as average number of jobs in the system, the average time a job spends in the system and the blocking probability.

Project description:
---------------------
Given a queuing system consisting of two machines generating components that are sent to a processing center for packaging. Rates of arrival/ departure for components at each machine and various other parameter values are also provided.

Simulating Markovian queueing system, calculate various performance measures for the given system:
a) Average number of components in the system.
b) Expected number of components in the system.
c) Average and Expected time spent by each component in the system.
d) Blocking probability
e) Throughput and Utilization of the system.

Platform:
----------
Java (jdk 1.8.0_66, jre 1.8.0_66), Eclipse for Java (4.6.0 Neon)

Compiler:
----------
Eclipse Compiler for Java (ECJ), an open source incremental compiler used by the Eclipse project.
